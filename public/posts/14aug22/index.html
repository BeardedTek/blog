<p>I sincerly hope you enjoyed reading my first post! Since my first post, I have learned a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>not</em> secured my site on Netlify (oops)</li>
<li>Securing it was very easy after I got it going</li>
<li>Git was much easier than I originally thought</li>
</ul>
<p>These all seem like very integral lessons to me! I think I may have had a breakthrough in what I would consider for my ultimate goal: <strong>SysAdmin</strong></p>
<h2 id="but-what-lead-me-here">But, What Lead Me Here?</h2>
<p>Well, dear reader, to put it bluntly, a programmer I am not. I would love nothing more than to develop some pretty sweet ideas I&rsquo;ve had bumping around in my head for awhile, but, alas, every time I sit to code or learn, I become extremely overwhelmed. I get a thrill in setting up new systems and guiding folks into a whole new land of operating their system, Windows or not. I would love nothing more than to re-learn all those networking skills and Windows Server, or even better <em>Linux Server Admin</em>.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-stand-to-gain-or-lose">What I Stand to Gain (or lose)</h3>
<p>Everything. Dear reader, I have been in a rut for a good while. I have felt stuck in the AirCap paradigm. While I may not be able to move cities, I am sure there is a place for me somewhere.
I attended college at a now defunct school and gained some knowledge, however, this was just at the precipise of Google gaining its foothold in all markets. By the time I had exited college, all of this schools course material (and by proxy, answers to stuff that I couldn&rsquo;t figure out) were all over the web. I did so poorly in a couple classes, I had to wind up using my internetisms to get a passing grade and Programming was at the top of that list.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-can-start-today-to-obtain-these-new-goals">How I Can Start TODAY to obtain these new goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, learn and learn often. My road will be fairly long and probably a pretty penny, too. A+ and Network+ are not cheap to do by really any stretch. I might be able to start with a Linux Essentials course and go for that route as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, get caught up with the latest tech and trends in the market. Its been about a decade since I have graduated college and tech has evolved. Cloud computing was just taking off big time. In the time since college (and just before I graduated) Google Drive was launched, Docker and Kubernetes started in 2013 and 2014, respectfully, cloud native exploded, SaaS and IaaS have come up, and thats just a few!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirdly, stay nimble. Stagnation will be my enemy and I cannot let it. Hell, I learned that IT has become ICT (Information and Communication Technology) just this evening.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I begun looking at the Linux Professional Institute&rsquo;s Linux Essentials course docs this eve, just before writing this. I will probably go over lesson 1.1 again, just to make sure I understand the course material.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-now">So, what now?</h2>
<p>For now, I sleep. Today was an action packed day of waking up at 5am to go to the gym, doing Diecast Car Racing, where I got a solid second place and my best car wasnt too far behind the best car in the whole 16, a family event, then some gaming with my wife. Tomorrow is a new day and I will go over the course material for 1.1 again after work, or even at lunch.
I hope you enjoyed the read! I hope your weekend went as expected and was full of fulfilment. Take some time for yourself and have that cup of coffee! I know I will be in the morning!</p>
<h2 id="this-weeks-foss-pick">This Weeks FOSS Pick</h2>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot! I would love to do a weekly FOSS pick of something I use or have started using as of late. This week, I have to give it up to Remarkable. This is the Markdown editor I use ALL the time. It is a very intutive piece of software that uses Github-flavored markdown, but, supports regular expression as well. It syntax highlights and has a live viewer that shows you your output. Its lightweight and you can get it on Windows or Linux. You can find them at <a href="https://remarkableapp.github.io/">Remarkable</a></p>
<p>As always, be kind to one another.</p>
