      <description>A Very Warm Thanks Thank you. For those of you that sent a few sats, it is much appreciated. Even if for a meme or because you believe the dream, it means the world to me.
Unfortunately, for me, I am more of a thinker and a logistics guy than a super talented coder. Coding makes me want to have a headbutt contest with a wall and see who taps out first.</description>
