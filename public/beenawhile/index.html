				<div class="entry__content"><h1 id="been-eight-long-months">Been Eight Long Months</h1>
<p>Well, hello! It has been a <em>hot</em> minute! I wish I had some <em>woe as me</em> or some <em>e x c u s e</em> to give here, but, alas, I do not. I have been far too over my head with life and put this on the back burner! So -</p>
<h2 id="what-have-i-been-up-to">What Have I Been Up To?</h2>
<p>In the last eight months, I have been promoted at work, moved back to my old spot at work, attempting to start my own business in the creative works and been overall overwhelmed. I have also aquired a Mac Mini and a third 3D Printer! As I write this, I am making a stand for the Mac so that it can get adequate airflow. If I get too big about it, I will just do that big fan mod.</p>
<h2 id="wait-you-said-a-business">Wait, you said a business?</h2>
<p>I did, indeed! My wife and I are trying (poorly) to start our own business. She does Cricut and heat press as well as Stainless Steel cup modding and glass etching, and I am on the 3D Printing efforts! We are on Etsy as <a href="https://KittermanCreative.etsy.com">Kitterman Creative</a>! We don&rsquo;t have much on there, but, you can message us ideas and we can potentially shoot you a quote! You are also free to email us at <a href="mailto:kittermancreative@gmail.com">kittermancreative@gmail.com</a>. Just make sure that you put something about a design or a quote in there. I do offer print services as well if you don&rsquo;t already have a servicer handy. Shipping is <em>fairly reasonable</em> in the states /s.</p>
<h3 id="the-good-and-the-bad">The Good and The Bad</h3>
<p>If you would like to use me for your printing services, I can only ship in the US until I figure out international stuff.</p>
<h2 id="how-has-racing-been-going">How has racing been going?</h2>
<p>It goes. I have been on and off with it as I have had one podium in a long while and it was on a new course! I do hope to get some new cars built over the next few weeks and get back to the weekly grind. This is an off week and I&rsquo;ll be out of the racing for a bit as I make some extra cheese cleaning large format CNC machines. My latest attempts are at big sprinter vans to see if I can get these usually top heavy beasts running straight down the track at breakneck speeds!</p>
<h2 id="current-goals">Current Goals</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to get my business going full-time over the next couple years. I would also love to keep this blog active and all that nonsense. Getting my thoughts out of my head and onto a medium is a bit theraputic!</p>
<h3 id="how-tos">How to&rsquo;s</h3>
<p>To get to the self-sufficient point in my business, I really need to either find a niche or just print stuff thats not toys. Also, I need to improve my print quality as well, as I know it lacks a bit. My only etsy order, we did get a five star on, however, so, that was cool!</p>
<p>Another goal of mine is to learn Rust or LUA, maybe both. This Mac is really snappy and I want to take full advantage of that. Rust seems to have some great advantages over many other languages and it would be really cool to learn. Maybe I would also like to learn Ruby-Rails and the like? Who knows.</p>
<h2 id="pick-of-the-week">Pick of the week</h2>
<p>Warp Terminal! This is a terminal built in Rust and is VERY snappy and responsive. Currently, it is MacOS only, but, it looks to have some planned releases for Linux, Windows, and Web Assembly! I would also like to give a special shout out to Coder Radio and Gamer Radio this week. Look them up in your podcast player of choice. Heck, just all of the JB Pods and Gamer Radio.</p>
<h1 id="well-as-all-good-things">Well, as all good things&hellip;</h1>
<p>I have also created an Alby wallet - <a href="mailto:thegoldendragon@getalby.com">thegoldendragon@getalby.com</a> and I have a PayNyms as well, +restlessfrost7E3</p>
<p>If you feel like donating to me, thats appreciated, but, this blog will remain free! Thank you all for reading and until next time, be kind to one another.</p>
