# The Fallacy

Welcome, once again to my blog, where I sometimes muse over non-technical topics and ask for advice. 

This morning, that question is this: What are some ways that you have dealt with depression?

I'll be fairly candid with you - I have a very hard time dealing with myself sometimes. I never really learned great coping mechanisms and had some incredible hardships before I was 21. 
For the last (I think?) five or six years, I have been on a couple medications that have helped immensely with being able to lift myself up. 

**HOWEVER**

This falls flat on its face when either:

- I cant afford my refill at the beginning of the month
or, in this month's case
- My doctor doesn't approve my refills

So, four days ago from the writing of this post, I get my normal call from my pharmacy for my auto-refill.
"Great!" I tell myself. I love this system because I am pretty forgetful in all honesty. This allows me to set it and forget it and let the system work.
A couple days go by and I take my last dose, awaiting the call for pickup. *Spoiler, it still hasn't come.*
I call both my pharmacy and my doctor and let them know. Pharmacy pokes my doctors office, doctors office is hopefully aware. 

Well, yesterday comes and my meds are still on hold. I call my doctor's office who tells me, "This is why we need a 48h notice."

*The pharmacy poked them 48h prior to my meds running out and apparently they never got the message.*

I am wholly unaware where or how the system failed, but, it seems to now have begun to fail me. 

## Side Effects

The doctor's office I visit doesn't perscribe the super crazy stuff since the system is easily abusable and ripe for illicit sales. Fair enough, I am a fan of this policy.
One of the medications I am on is called Pristiq. Marketed to me as a fairly new medication at the time that reacted well to men and seemed to help them a bit more. That was great to hear!
However, I found out the hard way that there was a massive trade off for that the first time I was unable to get my medication.

For me, after about 36-48h after not taking my perscribed dose, the ill effects begin

- Lightheadedness
- Fatigue
- Dizziness
- Shift in mood

I really, *really*, **REALLY** don't like these effects. I am a driver by trade. Folks rely heavily on me. 

Awhile back, I [read a book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/21235744) about this exact thing. 

The tagline for this book is, "Pristiq is a potent drug which may have saved the author's life. But when the depression passes, Pristiq is a drug almost impossible to discontinue, producing powerful and bizarre withdrawal effects like dizziness, electric zaps, ringing ears, brain fog and throbbing headaches."

*As I read this, I realize I forgot to mention THE MASSIVE BRAIN FOG*

I now wonder if I should chat with my doc about coming off my meds. It is better for my DOT efforts and I don't want to have to feel like I am relying on a crutch, you know?

I will update you on this soon as I have an appointment today (as of writing). 

I would LOVE some feedback and tips [in my inbox](email:tgdhaku@proton.me)

In the meantime, be good to one another.
