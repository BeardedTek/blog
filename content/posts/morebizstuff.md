# What Is Up, Gamers?

As one of my old favorite YouTubers used to say, "Whadizuuuuuup?" TGD coming at you with another candid update!

The last couple weeks have been pretty challenging as far as business and figuring out new processes. We have had some electrical issues plague us and machine issues, bleh. BUT, I have a small update!

## I ordered coffee, not tea!

Well, hope you like Earl Grey, cause, I have some updates. 

I launched the Kitterman Creative Square store, but, I need to do some catalogue changes for that. I sincerely hope that there is a RFQ type thing. 
The second piece of news is - LinuxFest Northwest is fast approaching and I need your help!

While I am going to do my damndest to be there (I am the LUP mascot after all!), this will present some challenges:

| Item | Cost |
|:-:|:-:|
| Roundtrip Flight | 330 |
| Lodging | 100 |
| Car Rental | 150 |
| Fuel | 100 |
| Food | 50 |
| Other Costs | 100 |
| SUM | 830 |

I was going to have a friend with me, but, it appears that this may not happen now. In all reality, I should have been saving for this trip since it was announced, but, I just got into a place where it could be feasible.

In my current financial situation, I have six checks to come up with the end goal funds myself.

If things go according to my current plan, it would go:

| Timetable | Pay For |
|:-:|:-:|
| Month out | Book flight |
| Six Weeks | Hotel |
| Two Months | Car Rental |

Then from there, just have money at the ready.

## How Can I Help?

There are a few ways:

| Service | Name |
|:-:|:-:|
| Paypal | @goldenblogathon |
| Strike | strike.me/gdhaku |
| Alby | thegoldendragon@getalby.com |

Definitely dont feel obligated to donate to my cause, but, any help is INSANELY appreciated. 

If I can go, I will be making a shirt that has what I have used as my logo for TGD and on the back would say,
" Does YOUR podcast have a mascot?"

## In Bitcoin News

I am learning to open up channels on the Lightning Network and OH BOY. I really embarassed myself on this one. 
So, there I am , looking to open up a 100k Sat channel in a triangle config and I didnt know that the liquidity was on chain to LN. Womp womp. Hopefully the third guy doesnt back out, I will have the liquidity soon. 

## In Tech News

There I am this eve, browsing Hacker News and BOOM. *GNU Boot Cease and Desist Letter* The GNU Boot folks at the FSF sent Libreboot a[C&D letter](https://libreboot.org/news/gnuboot.html#gnu-boot-cease-and-desist-email) citing TM Infringement. The Project has been renamed to *non-GeNUine Boot* in the meantime. Whats your opinion? I'd love to know your thoughts on this. 

If you have any questions/comments/words to say, send me an email at: [tgdhaku@proton.me](email:tgdhaku@proton.me)

Hope to hear from you all soon! be kind to one another.
