# What a Whirlwind

Hello again! So, I promiosed a post-appointment update and here we are. 

According to my mental health doctor, she had no idea that my refills were being ignored. I followed protocol, etc.

Tl;dr, was able to get my refills taken care of and I am in a much better state than I was this morning. 

## So, what happened?

That, is the real question. While I don't like self-diagnosing, what I found was that I was suffering from [Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5449237/)

This is a common (1 in 5 patients) syndrome after sudden stoppage of antidepressants taken for atleast one month. 

Essentially, what makes sense is this:

- F: Flu-like symptoms (lethargy, malaise, headache)
- I: Insomnia (I hadn't gotten there quite yet, but, was headed there fast)
- N: Nausea
- I: Imbalance (from light-headedness to vertigo)
- S: Sensory disturbances (tingling, hyper sensitivity, "electric shocks")
- H: Hyperarousal (anxiety, irritability, mania, etc)

Venlafaxine/Desvenlafaxine has a half-life of 11 hours. So missing a day of meds really screws with you.
I took my meds around 1430 my time and by about 1700 I was feeling much more like myself again, albeit incredibly mentally exhausted. 

## What can we learn from this?

Dont abrubptly stop your meds, folks. In my case, this was totally unintentional. However, I have now talked with my doctor about looking to ween off maybe starting in a few months. 
I went through the emotional ringer today - Mad, irritated, frustrated to tears, just absolutely done, odd laughing phases. 

Don't do it, folks. Talk with a professional.
