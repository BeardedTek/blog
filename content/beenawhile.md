# Been Eight Long Months

Well, hello! It has been a *hot* minute! I wish I had some *woe as me* or some *e x c u s e* to give here, but, alas, I do not. I have been far too over my head with life and put this on the back burner! So -

## What Have I Been Up To?
	
In the last eight months, I have been promoted at work, moved back to my old spot at work, attempting to start my own business in the creative works and been overall overwhelmed. I have also aquired a Mac Mini and a third 3D Printer! As I write this, I am making a stand for the Mac so that it can get adequate airflow. If I get too big about it, I will just do that big fan mod. 

## Wait, you said a business?

I did, indeed! My wife and I are trying (poorly) to start our own business. She does Cricut and heat press as well as Stainless Steel cup modding and glass etching, and I am on the 3D Printing efforts! We are on Etsy as [Kitterman Creative](https://KittermanCreative.etsy.com)! We don't have much on there, but, you can message us ideas and we can potentially shoot you a quote! You are also free to email us at kittermancreative@gmail.com. Just make sure that you put something about a design or a quote in there. I do offer print services as well if you don't already have a servicer handy. Shipping is *fairly reasonable* in the states /s.

### The Good and The Bad
If you would like to use me for your printing services, I can only ship in the US until I figure out international stuff. 

## How has racing been going?

It goes. I have been on and off with it as I have had one podium in a long while and it was on a new course! I do hope to get some new cars built over the next few weeks and get back to the weekly grind. This is an off week and I'll be out of the racing for a bit as I make some extra cheese cleaning large format CNC machines. My latest attempts are at big sprinter vans to see if I can get these usually top heavy beasts running straight down the track at breakneck speeds!

## Current Goals
I'd love to get my business going full-time over the next couple years. I would also love to keep this blog active and all that nonsense. Getting my thoughts out of my head and onto a medium is a bit theraputic! 
### How to's
To get to the self-sufficient point in my business, I really need to either find a niche or just print stuff thats not toys. Also, I need to improve my print quality as well, as I know it lacks a bit. My only etsy order, we did get a five star on, however, so, that was cool! 

Another goal of mine is to learn Rust or LUA, maybe both. This Mac is really snappy and I want to take full advantage of that. Rust seems to have some great advantages over many other languages and it would be really cool to learn. Maybe I would also like to learn Ruby-Rails and the like? Who knows. 

## Pick of the week
Warp Terminal! This is a terminal built in Rust and is VERY snappy and responsive. Currently, it is MacOS only, but, it looks to have some planned releases for Linux, Windows, and Web Assembly! I would also like to give a special shout out to Coder Radio and Gamer Radio this week. Look them up in your podcast player of choice. Heck, just all of the JB Pods and Gamer Radio.
